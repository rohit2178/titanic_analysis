# titanic_analysis
The attached notebook "titanic_analysis.ipynb" provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing on the Titanic dataset. Here is a summary of the key components and findings:

# Data Overview
The dataset includes passenger details such as Survived (target variable), Pclass, Name, Gender, Age, SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard), Parch (parents/children aboard), Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked (port of embarkation).

Initial data cleaning and examination were done, including handling missing values and creating new features like FamilySize.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizations of passenger demographics (gender distribution, age distribution, fare by class).

Analysis showing survival proportions, revealing that a higher percentage of females survived compared to males.

Survival analysis across different passenger classes (Pclass) and age distributions.

Boxplots and countplots demonstrate variations in survival by gender, class, and age.

# Hypothesis Testing
Conducted independent t-tests comparing age distributions between survivors and non-survivors, showing statistically significant age differences.

Chi-square tests were performed to examine relationships between categorical variables like gender and survival status, confirming significant associations.

Samples were taken and compared for male vs. female survival rates, yielding p-values supporting the rejection of the null hypothesis that there is no difference in survival by gender.

# Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates than males.

Younger passengers had a relatively higher chance of survival.

Passengers in higher classes (first class) were more likely to survive.

Family size and embarked location might also influence survival, though analysis is less highlighted.

# Conclusion
The notebook thoroughly performs both descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze Titanic data. The hypothesis testing confirms significant factors influencing survival, mainly gender and age, with visualizations supporting these insights.

This summary encapsulates the structure and results of the detailed Titanic data analysis and hypothesis testing performed in the notebook. If specific sections or code explanations are needed, they can also be extracted.The attached notebook conducts a detailed exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing on the Titanic dataset. It starts with cleaning and preparing the data, analyzes passenger demographics (gender, age, class), and visualizes survival distribution. Key findings show significantly higher survival rates among females, younger passengers, and first-class passengers. Hypothesis tests (t-tests and Chi-square) confirm these factors have statistically significant effects on survival. Overall, the notebook combines descriptive statistics, visual exploration, and inferential testing to uncover insights about survival determinants on the Titanic.
